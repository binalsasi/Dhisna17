	HighFalls is an exercise to train to use stacks to solve complicated problem.
	There are N person standing in a row. Each one has different heights. But these people are envious of people higher than them
	standing at their right. If a person A who stands to the right of a person B, if A is higher than B then A dies (police investigations 
	are of no use). In each day, if any person is higher than his left neighbour, he dies.
	People of Same heights live though. Also even though a person has died, the body remains until the end of the day.

 	If given N heights, calculate and print the number of days until an equilibrium is reached. That is no person dies anymore.

	for example:
	consider 8 persons, of heights	3 1 10 7 3 5 6 6
	after first day 10 has died, so has 5 and his immediate neighbour 6.
	remaining = 3 1 7 3 6
	after day 2 it is : 3 1 3
	after day 3 it is : 3 1
	after day 4, no more deaths. So number of days until peace is 3.
